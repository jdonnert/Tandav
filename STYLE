This is the Style Guide :

* IF the code is broader than 79 characters, you are doing it wrong.
* WE indent like the Linux kernel - Linus is right.
* VARIABLES are initialised when declared. Index vars are the obvious exception.
* GLOBAL variables have long meaningful names. 
* LOCAL variables may be short to ease reading.
* MACROS are capitalised and ugly.
* Comments are // on the side, /**/ on the line.
* return; is not a function.
