This class provides a simple cosmological calculator for various quantities
By setting the cosmological parameters in the object: 

IDL> cosmo.set,1
Concordance Cosmology :
    H0      = 70.0 km/s/Mpc
    Omega_L = 0.70
    Omega_M = 0.30
    Omega_b = 0.04
    Omega_r = 0.00
    sigma_8 = 0.80
    Horizon = 4282.7 Mpc

all quantities are calculated consistently with these parameters :

IDL> print, cosmo.rho_crit(0.188)
